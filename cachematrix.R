## Caching the Inverse of a Matrix:
## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some 
## benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly.
## Below are a pair of functions that are used to create a special object that 
## stores a matrix and caches its inverse.
##
## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  inv <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    inv <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinv <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse
  getinv <- function() inv
  list(set = set,
       get = get,
       setinv = setinv,
       getinv = getinv)
}


## cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by 
## makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated 
## (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.
## Computing the inverse of a square matrix can be done with the solve function in R. 
## For example, if X is a square invertible matrix, then solve(X) returns its inverse.
## For this assignment, assume that the matrix supplied is always invertible.




cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  inv <- x$getinv()
  if (!is.null(inv)) {
    message("returning cached data")
    return(inv)
  }
  mat <- x$get()
  inv <- solve(mat, ...)
  x$setinv(inv)
  return (inv)
}
